    <h2><strong>What is the 'Gross National Happiness - GNH'</strong></h2>
    <p>The Gross National Happiness (GNH) is an aggregate measure of a country's national production, in the vein of the gross national product or gross domestic product. Gross national happiness (GNH) attempts to measure the sum total not only of economic output, but also of net environmental impacts, the spiritual and cultural growth of citizens, mental and physical health and the strength of the corporate and political systems.<br>It is a developing philosophy as well as an "index" which is used to measure the collective happiness in any specific nation.</p>
    <h3><strong>Where did this idea come from?</strong></h3>
    <p>The term "gross national happiness" was coined by the fourth king of Bhutan, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, in the 1970s. The GNH's central tenets are: "sustainable and equitable socio-economic development; environmental conservation; preservation and promotion of culture; and good governance" 
      Bhutan measures prosperity by gauging its citizens' happiness levels, not the GDP.<br><br>Since 1971, the country has rejected GDP as the only way to measure progress. In its place, it has championed a new approach to development, which measures prosperity through formal principles of gross national happiness (GNH) and the spiritual, physical, social and environmental health of its citizens and natural environment. This big idea from a tiny state have since influenced the world.</p>

        <h5><strong>Why should I know about this?</strong></h5>
        <p>By realising the mental health of a nation is probably more important than economic growth for a state is the same as understanding that for humans, our mental health is just as important as our physical health. 
          People in the modern society is extremely vulnerable to mental health issues. 54% of people with mental illness do not access any treatment. According to BlackDogInstitute, the mid-to-late adolescence (18-24 years old) have the highest prevalence of mental illness than any other age group. The 2014 Mission Australia’s Youth Survey also showed that around one in five of people aged between 15-19 years old met the criteria for a probable serious mental illness.  
          Therefore, people have come up with ways to measure nations’ happiness and take actions towards it. For example, A behavioural model of “Gross National Happiness” was developed by Adam Kramer from the University of Oregon where he used positive and negative words in social network status updates, resulting in a quantitative GNH metric.<br><br>Through the development of measuring happiness through social media platform like Facebook, we have derived conclusions such as there is a 9.7% increase in happiness on Fridays compare to the worst day of the week, Monday.</p>
