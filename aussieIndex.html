  <h1><strong>Australia's Happiness Index</strong></h1>
  <section id = "box-body">

  <p><img src = "img/Map.jpg" align = "left">According to the World Happiness Report, Australia is ranked the 9th happiest planet in the world, that is  out of 150 countries surveyed! It is a nation that performs very well in many measures of well-being relative to most other countries in the Happiness Index. Australia is a country blessed with an extremely good  quality of life, health, education, economic freedom,  civil liberties and political rights. In fact, Australia is ranked 2nd globally on the human development index, a composite statistic of life expectancy, education, and per capita income indicators.<br><br>The poll included a question, known as the Cantril Ladder: "Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?"<br><br>The scholars found that three-quarters of the variation across countries could be explained by six variables: gross domestic product per capita (the rawest measure of a nation's wealth); healthy years of life expectancy; social support (as measured by having someone to count on in times of trouble); trust (as measured by perceived absence of corruption in government and business); perceived freedom to make life choices; and generosity (as measured by donations).<br>Overall, Australia ranked globally below nations such as Switzerland, New Zealand, and Denmark, and ranked above nations such as USA, China and Japan. Overall, the aim of the report, is to provide another tool for governments, business and civil society to help their countries find a better way to wellbeing. Something Australia apparently needs to do!<br><br>So that leads to the question, how happy are you?  Try out  our happiness calculator to find out your  happiness score! Not happy with how YOU rank?
